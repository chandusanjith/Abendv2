ABEND uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Google Materilizecss] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [CKEditor] - awesome web-based text editor
* [Django] - evented I/O for the backend
* [AWS EC2] - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud is a part of Amazon.com's cloud-computing platform, Amazon Web Services, that allows users to rent virtual computers on which to run their own computer applications.
* [NGINX] - Nginx, stylized as NGINX or nginx or NginX, is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache. The software was created by Igor Sysoev and publicly released in 2004. Nginx is free and open-source software, released under the terms of the 2-clause BSD license.
